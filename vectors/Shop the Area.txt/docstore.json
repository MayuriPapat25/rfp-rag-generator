Our disaster recovery plan includes RTO targets of 4 hours and RPO targets of 1 hour, tested quarterly.\n\n\nQuestion: What measures are in place to protect against DDoS attacks?\nAnswer: We utilize multi-layered DDoS mitigation strategies, including network-level filtering, rate limiting, and scrubbing centers. Our systems are continuously monitored for unusual traffic patterns to detect and mitigate attacks proactively.\n\n\nQuestion: Do you offer multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user access?\nAnswer: Yes, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all administrative access to our platform. Users can choose from various MFA methods, including TOTP and hardware tokens.","metadata":{"filename":"Shop the Area.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":10}}},"id":"d25e882b-5c16-4f5a-b774-ff612d5699f6"}],["b4be9e51-605c-4509-be8d-5caf2e6159f1",{"pageContent":"Question: How often are security patches and updates applied to your systems?\nAnswer: Critical security patches are applied within 24 hours of release, while non-critical updates are deployed on a weekly schedule during designated maintenance windows to minimize disruption.\n\n\nQuestion: What kind of data encryption is used for data at rest and in transit?\nAnswer: All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
